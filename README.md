# data_visualization_and_manipulation

Analyse, describe, manipulate and visualize data of the famous Fatal Police Shoot database created by Washington Post in 2015 and crossing data with some other datasets.

In order to unravel the possible racial bias, I am going to use the dataset made by Washingtion Post concerning the fatal police shoots during the period 2015-2021 in the United States. This dataset has been created after Micheal Brown kill in Ferguson, which gave birth to Black Lives Matter movement. Furthermore, I'll be using others dataset such those on the percentage of high school completion, the rate of poverty, the 2016 US election and lastly the one about race and age by state.

Preface: most of the scientific community agrees on the evidence that human races don't genetically exist. The genetic difference were found at the individual level (85%) and cannot be related to population mutations (only 15%). Indeed, race is a preconcept and a statement that may defines cultural differences among groups of people, as this article explains: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/1998-10/WUiS-GSRD-071098.php#

Despite this relevant evidence, for an easier understanding of the analysis, I will keep the name 'race' to indicate that variable.

My work is going to focus on the possible bias that US policemen may have shown in their actions!
